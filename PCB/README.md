# KLOTZ PCB

## MANUFACTURING
If you want to get the PCB made you need to upload the **KLOTZ_0-2_gerbers.zip** file to the website of the manufacture ([JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) for example).

- upload the ZIP
- sometimes the Gerber preview from JLCPCB can't display the PCB, even when the files are fine. In this case use this dimensions: 120.5 mm* 85.5 mm
- PCB Thickness 1.6mm
- 2 layers
- PCB Qty as much as you like. But be aware, that you need 2 PCBs for one keyboard
- PCB Color Black
- No impedance control
- Surface Finish HASL(with lead) if you want the easiest soldering experience or LeadFree HASL.
- Remove Order Number Yes
