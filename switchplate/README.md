# KLOTZ SWITCHPLATE

If you plan to use the KLOTZ with hotswap sockets you should use a switchplate. If you plan on solder in the switches it looks nicer.

## MANUFACTURING
If you want to get the switchplate made you need to upload the **KLOTZ_0-2_plate_gerbers.zip** file to the website of the manufacture ([JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) for example).

- upload the ZIP
- sometimes the Gerber preview from JLCPCB can't display the PCB, even when the files are fine. In this case use this dimensions: 120.5 mm* 85.5 mm
- PCB Thickness 1.2mm (this is crucial to make Choc switches snap in)
- 2 layers
- PCB Qty as much as you like. But be aware, that you need 2 plates for one keyboard
- PCB Color Black
- No impedance control
- Surface Finish HASL(with lead) or LeadFree HASL
- Remove Order Number Yes
- Flying Probe Test Not Test
